### Project aspects:

developed a server.js file to establish a connection with MongoDB and launch the localhost on port 3000.

Routes: I've created MainRoute routers for various operations, each directing to the Users for their respective functions.
Controllers: Within controllers, individual methods have been set up for different operations, utilizing await and async to manage MongoDB tasks efficiently.
Models: In models, I've defined the schema for the user table, including password encryption using bcrypt before storage in the database.
